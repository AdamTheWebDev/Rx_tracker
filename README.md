This project was inspired by my previous experience working in a pharmacy.
The idea is to have a place where patients to go and log what information they have on
the medications they take. Sometimes patients take multiple medications and at different times.
The patient can add new medications to their profile and also view the image of that medication.

The technology used is Ruby on Rails with devise for authentication.
I called the images from National prescription drug library.
